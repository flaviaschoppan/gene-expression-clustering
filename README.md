# Gene Expression Clustering

This repository contains a technical demonstration of an unsupervised clustering workflow applied to gene expression data.

It illustrates how clustering algorithms can be applied after basic preprocessing and transformation steps, with the sole purpose of demonstrating workflow structure and code organization.

This project is not intended for biological interpretation, model evaluation, or analytical decision-making.  
It is maintained as a technical reference and is not under active development.
